Technical Report Project: Proposal

Project Topic: Summer Speech Supplemental Materials 

Background and Message
The purpose of this project is to present a proposal intended to encourage solutions for issues regarding school-administered speech services. While classes are suspended in the summertime, children who are regularly enrolled in speech services during the school year are left without consistent speech therapy. Because of this, students are put at risk for regression which potentially poses a hindrance in future academic progress. Missing months of speech therapy not only affects the student, but it also presents more work for parents, speech-language pathologists, teachers, and school administrators to collectively reacclimate the child. The goal of the proposal is to counteract the negative consequences of missing important therapy and to establish methods for parents and speech-language pathologists to work collaboratively. 

Users/Audience
The intended audience for this proposal is likely to consist of individuals in roles that affect a student’s academic progress, such as parents, teachers, and school administrators involved with knowledge of special education services and curriculum design.
