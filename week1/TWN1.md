### TWN #1: Define Technical Writing

**Technical writing** is a style of writing that is direct, clear, and concise. Works of technical writing provide the reader with instructions or information that is organized according to a certain format. The purpose of technical writing is to present material as clearly as possible" (Katzoff 6). 

Finding examples of technical writing in everyday life is easier than one might think. I think of user manuals and My fiance and I recently purchased a new couch from IKEA. I immediately thought of [this assembly guide.](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/assembly_instructions/tomback-sofa-with-adjustable-seat-back__AA-1994907-2.pdf). While there are not many written instructions within the assembly guide, the visual instructions are clear (or *clear enough* for my fiance and I to assemble the couch).

In technical writing, word choice is very important. Emotionally-charged statements and biased language are avoided and instead, words are meant to contribute to the efficacy and purpose of the message.

One of the primary differences between technical writing and academic writing is the audience and purpose. Technical writing has a very clear purpose - to release information or to demonstrate something. The purpose is stated and the work is organized in such a way that the audience *knows* that it's there for. Academic writing, on the other hand, may not always have a definite audience. In addition, in academic writing there is room for arguments and refutations to be made. In addition, information and data can be presented in a way that is advantageous to the writer. Statistics can be manipulated, and word choice and language can help to suggest certain ideas. Technical writing is more "plain text" and instead of suggesting an idea, the idea is identified and usually included in a separate section for conclusions.
